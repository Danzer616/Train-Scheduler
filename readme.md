# Train Schedule

### Overview

For this assignment, the objective was to create a train schedule app that incorporates Google Firebase to host arrival and departure data, similar to an employee scheduler. The app retrieves data with Moment.js and provides up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

### Requirements

* App specifications/criteria:
  * When adding trains, administrators should be able to submit the following:
    * Train Name
    * Destination 
    * First Train Time -- in military time
    * Frequency -- in minutes
  * Calculate when the next train will arrive; relative to the current time.
  * Users from many different machines must be able to view same train times.

### Added Functionality

* Form Validation for correct time input
